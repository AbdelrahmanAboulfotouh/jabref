        Background: Consumption of chocolate has been often hypothesized to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to chocolate's high levels of stearic acid and antioxidant flavonoids. However, debate still lingers regarding the true long term beneficial cardiovascular effects of chocolate overall.
        Methods: We reviewed English-language MEDLINE publications from 1966 through January 2005 for experimental, observational, and clinical studies of relations between cocoa, cacao, chocolate, stearic acid, flavonoids ( including flavonols, flavanols, catechins, epicatechins, and procynadins) and the risk of cardiovascular disease ( coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke). A total of 136 publications were selected based on relevance, and quality of design and methods. An updated meta-analysis of flavonoid intake and CHD mortality was also conducted.
        Results: The body of short-term randomized feeding trials suggests cocoa and chocolate may exert beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk via effects on lowering blood pressure, anti-inflammation, anti-platelet function, higher HDL, decreased LDL oxidation. Additionally, a large body of trials of stearic acid suggests it is indeed cholesterol-neutral. However, epidemiologic studies of serum and dietary stearic acid are inconclusive due to many methodologic limitations. Meanwhile, the large body of prospective studies of flavonoids suggests the flavonoid content of chocolate may reduce risk of cardiovascular mortality. Our updated meta-analysis indicates that intake of flavonoids may lower risk of CHD mortality, RR = 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71 - 0.92) comparing highest and lowest tertiles.
        Conclusion: Multiple lines of evidence from laboratory experiments and randomized trials suggest stearic acid may be neutral, while flavonoids are likely protective against CHD mortality.

Sucrose is utilized up to 30-60% in chocolate and this confers multiple functional properties on chocolate including sweetness, bulkiness and mouthfeel (texture). Today’s consumers are concerned about the high sugar levels, calories and cariogenicity effects in confectionery products, hence growing the popularity of “light” and “sugar-free” products. This has led to the search for low calorie, low glycemic index, healthier alternatives. Polydextrose and inulin are considered as fibers with many interesting functional attributes that meet the needs of the food industry for healthy foods. Stevia and thaumatin are natural high potency (intense) sweeteners with sensory properties superior to those of other sweeteners. This research investigated the functionality of inulin and polydextrose as sucrose replacers (bulking agents) in sugar-free dark chocolates with stevia or thaumatin as intense sweeteners. The type of bulking agent and concentrations used greatly influenced the rheological properties, textural, melting behaviours and other physical quality characteristics of the developed sugar-free chocolates. Microstructural examination revealed that inulin, which had a lower density than polydextrose tend to have more solids per volume and increased particle volume fraction and solid’s surface area, resulting in a higher particle collision and aggregation thereby limiting chocolate flow. This research also reports for the first time, results of a comparative study of the sweetness brought by the intense sweeteners (stevia and thaumatin) in the sugar-free dark chocolates.
